# Awesome CF Generation
This repository contains the frontier research on counterfactual generation which is a hot topic recently.  A counterfactual means XXXX(definition Todo). Here are some examples of counterfactuals based on sentiment anlysis and natural language inference task.

## Automatic CF Generation
CF generation studies are relative with language models,such as traditional pretrained models, e.g., bert and roberta, etc. or  large language models, e.g., gpt-3.5 and llama.
